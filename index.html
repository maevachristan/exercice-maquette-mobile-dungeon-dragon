        <h3>About the Series</h3>
        <p>Season 3 of Stranger Things-the Netflix show brought to you by the 
           Duffer Brothers-released on July 4th. We won't spoil exactly what 
           dangers the kids (and frankly, the entirety of Hawkins, Indiana) 
           faced this year, although suffice to say that a mind flayer (of 
           sorts) rears its head. And of course, you can also expect a fair 
           amount of Dungeons & Dragons play... or at least attempted, with 
           everything else going on!
        </p>
        <p>If you've followed the show, you know how D&D plays a major role in 
           the lives of these characters. If you played the game yourself back 
           in the 1980's, or inerested to see what's underway with the game 
           today, read on!
