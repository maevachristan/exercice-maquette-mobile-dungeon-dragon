        <h3>About the Series</h3>
        <p>Season 3 of Stranger Things-the Netflix show brought to you by the 
          Duffer Brothers-released on July 4th. We won't spoil exactly what 
          dangers the kids (and frankly, the entirety of Hawkins, Indiana) faced 
          this year, although suffice to say that a mind flayer (of sorts) rears 
          its head. And of course, you can also expect a fair amount of Dungeons 
          & Dragons play... or at least attempted, with everything else going on!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>If you've followed the show, you know how D&D plays a major role in 
          the lives of these characters. If you played the game yourself back 
          in the 1980's, or inerested to see what's underway with the game today
          , read on!
